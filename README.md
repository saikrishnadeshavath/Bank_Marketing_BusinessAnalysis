# Bank_Marketing_BusinessAnalysis
This project involved a comprehensive business analysis of a bank marketing dataset to predict customer subscription to a term deposit. We began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), examining data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics. We visualized the distribution of the target variable ('y'), revealing a significant class imbalance. We also explored categorical features (job, marital, education) and numerical features (age, balance, duration, etc.), visualizing their distributions and relationships with the target variable. Key insights from EDA included the strong association of 'duration' with subscription and the influence of certain job types, marital statuses, and education levels.

For feature engineering and data preprocessing, we handled categorical variables through one-hot encoding and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE oversampling. Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler.

We then trained and evaluated two classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The Random Forest model demonstrated slightly better performance across key metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC) compared to Logistic Regression.

Interpretation of the models highlighted the most influential features for predicting subscription. Consistently, the duration of the last contact was a strong positive predictor. Other important factors included the outcome of previous campaigns (successful previous outcomes strongly increased the likelihood of subscription), certain months of the year, job types, contact methods, and housing loan status.

Based on these findings, key recommendations for the bank include optimizing campaign timing and targeting specific customer segments based on job, marital status, and education. Prioritizing customers with a history of successful previous campaigns is highly recommended. Improving contact strategies, focusing on effective communication to potentially increase contact duration, and addressing the lower subscription rates among customers with housing loans are also important. Further investigation into the reasons behind the influence of specific months and job types can refine future marketing efforts.
